  <h3> Color Psychology </h3>
  <body>
  <p> How people respond to colour is of great interest to those who work in marketing. Colour psychology research is often focused on how the colour of a logo or a product will yield higher sales, and what colour preferences can be found in certain age groups and cultures. The study of the psychological effects of colour have coincided with colour theory in general. Goethe focused on the experience of colour in his Zur farbenlehre from 1810, (1) in opposition to Sir Isaac Newton’s rational approach. Goethe and Schiller coupled colours to character traits: red for beautiful, yellow for good, green for useful, and blue for common. Gestalt psychology in the early 1900s also attributed universal emotions to colours, a theory that was taught to students at the Bauhaus by Wassily Kandinsky.The best known colour psychology test was conducted by Max Lüscher in the 1940s, when he tested the responses of people to a series of coloured cards. A psychologist could interpret the person’s character based on the test results. The interpretation of this research in colour psychology is disputed, since it is not clear whether people respond to the colours or the cultural concept of the colour. It is more likely that the cultural context, our upbringing, and personal preferences influence our interpretation of colour more than anything else.(2) </p>
  <p> Some colour psychology findings have been proven to work ‘Cooler’ colours can have a calming influence on people, which is why hospitals and prison walls are often painted in a soft greenish colour. Another research shows that the colour of placebo pills influences their effectiveness. Blue coloured pills work better as depressants, and red colour pills better as stimulants. (3)  </p>
    
<p> Research shows that ninety-eight languages have words for the same
    eleven basic colours; (4) however, the meaning a colour may have can bevery different. There are conflicting theories on whether the cultural
    meanings of colours can be categorised. Meanings can change over
    time and depend on the context. Black may be the colour of mourning
    in many countries, though a black book cover or a black poster is not
    always associated with death. Another example is that brides in China
    traditionally wear red, but many brides have started to wear white in
    recent decades.4 The cultural meaning of colours is not set but always
    changing. The next few pages list some of the meanings of colours in
    different cultures.</p>

    <h3> Color and Culture</h3>

    <p> Research shows that ninety-eight languages have words for the same
        eleven basic colours;4 however, the meaning a colour may have can be
        very different. There are conflicting theories on whether the cultural
        meanings of colours can be categorised. Meanings can change over
        time and depend on the context. Black may be the colour of mourning
        in many countries, though a black book cover or a black poster is not
        always associated with death. Another example is that brides in China
        traditionally wear red, but many brides have started to wear white in
        recent decades.4 The cultural meaning of colours is not set but always
        changing. The next few pages list some of the meanings of colours in
        different cultures.</p>

        <h3> Black </h3>

        <p> was the colour of mourning during the Roman empire, and in Judaism
            and Christianity it is associated with death and evil. During the
            Middle Ages, black clothing became popular, and during the Renaissance
            it was worn by the wealthy and nobility in all parts of Europe.
            In the nineteenth century, the black army was the nickname of the
            Russian anarchists. In the twentieth century, black became the colour of
            Italian and German fascism, who were called blackshirts. In Shia Islam
            black is a very devout colour. The black standard is one of the flags of
            Muhammad in Islam. The black standard has been appropriated as a
            symbol by jihadism since the late 1990s.</p>

            <h3> White </h3>

            <p> is the colour of death and mourning in China, Vietnam, and Korea. In
                India, people wear white after the death of a family member. Jewish,
                Christian and Hindu religions use the colour white in rituals to indicate
                purity, chastity, virginity, and peace. White is the traditional colour
                of bridal dresses in Western cultures. In Europe, white was historically
                associated with absolute monarchy. It became synonymous in
                the twentieth century with anti-communist and counter-revolutionary
                movements in Russia. A white dove is an international sign of peace,
                and a white flag is the international sign of surrender. </p>

                <h3> Yellow </h3>

                <p> is the most visible colour from a distance, so it is often used for
                    objects that need high visibility, such as ambulances, road maintenance
                    equipment, and taxis. In East Asia, yellow is considered sacred
                    and imperial. In China it is the colour for royalty, and during the Qing
                    Dynasty, only members of the imperial household were permitted to
                    wear yellow. In China it is still seen as the colour of happiness, glory,
                    wisdom, harmony, and culture. Yellow is used to symbolise gold as
                    one of the colours of the Catholic church and the Vatican. Yellow in
                    Italian is giallo and a nickname for crime stories. The demonstrations
                    in the Philippines in 1986 were also known as the yellow revolution.</p>

                    <h3> Orange </h3>

                    <P> comes from the Sanskrit word for orange tree. In Asia it is known as
                        saffron, named after the spice. In Hinduism, the divinity Krishna is
                        portrayed dressed in saffron. In Buddhism, saffron is the colour of
                        illumination, the highest state of perfection, and the colour of robes
                        worn by monks. Orange ribbons are used to promote awareness and
                        prevention of self-injury. In Northern Ireland the protestant order is
                        called the Orangemen, who wear orange during annual marches.
                        Orange is the colour of the Dutch monarchy, and in South Africa,
                        orange was the colour of the ruling party during Apartheid. Prisoners
                        are often dressed in orange to make them distinctive in case of escape.</P>

                        <h3> Red </h3>

                        <p> comes from the Sanskrit word for blood. In Greek mythology it was
                            the colour for the planet Mars and the god of war. Red is the most
                            important colour in China and means good luck and happiness. Red
                            promotes long life, and it is used in Chinese new year celebrations.
                            Red is the traditional colour for brides in India and Nepal. In Japan,
                            a red kimono symbolises happiness and good luck. In Japan’s Shinto
                            religion, red is the symbol of life. The Russian word for red has the
                            same root in Old Russian as the word ‘beautiful’. The oldest symbol of
                            socialism is the red flag, and red is still associated with socialist and
                            communist parties. The red shirts, or the red movement, was the name
                            of those who opposed the 2006 military coup in Thailand. </p>

                            <h3> Green </h3>

                            <p> is the colour of nature in many cultures. Early rituals centred on the hope
                                of a good harvest with green vegetables. Green is the traditional colour
                                of Islam, the colour of the prophet Muhammed, which is why many
                                flags in the Islamic world use the colour green. Since the 1980s, green
                                has become the colour of environmental parties and organisations.
                                Green parties in Europe have programmes based on ecology and environment.
                                The word greenwashing is used to describe the advertising of
                                companies that use positive environmental practices to cover up environmentally
                                unfriendly activities. A ‘green room’ is used in television
                                and theatre to quiet nervous performers. </p>

                                <h3> Blue </h3>

                                <p> is tested as the colour that is best liked by all cultures, which is how
                                    it became the colour for international business. The United Nations
                                    chose blue as a colour in 1946, but the colour has no special significance.
                                    Bluewashing is a term for companies that join the United
                                    Nations ‘Global Impact Initiative’ only for PR reasons. ‘Blue collar
                                    worker’ refers to the shirts worn by people working manual labour
                                    jobs. The Tuareg of North Africa wear blue turbans, dyed with indigo.
                                    Azure blue is the national colour of Italy, the national soccer team is
                                    called the Azzurri. Several languages, like Japanese, Thai, Korean,
                                    and Lakota Sioux, use the same word to describe blue and green. </p>

                                    <h3> Purple </h3>

                                    <p> was the the most expensive dye in Roman times, and was worn by
                                        Roman magistrates, Byzantine emperors, and the rulers of the Holy
                                        Roman Empire. During the reign of Elizabeth I, only royalty was
                                        allowed to wear purple in England. Roman Catholic bishops still
                                        wear purple as a colour of royalty. In Japan, the colour is traditionally
                                        associated with the emperor and aristocracy. In Thailand, widows
                                        in mourning wear purple. In Western politics the colour purple is
                                        neutral, and used for a coalition between a left-wing and a right-wing
                                        party. The Women’s Suffrage movement used purple, and the colour
                                        was adopted in the 1970s by the women’s liberation movement. Purple
                                        and pink are both associated with the LGBT community. </p>
